IMPORTANT: You must base your analysis ONLY on the search results provided below. Do NOT use your training data or prior knowledge. The information in these search results is current and takes precedence over any previous information you may have.

SEARCH QUERY: "${query}"

CURRENT SEARCH RESULTS (BREAKING NEWS):
${searchResults.map((result, index) => `
${index + 1}. TITLE: ${result.title}
   URL: ${result.url}
   CONTENT: ${result.snippet}
`).join('\n')}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- ONLY use information from the search results above
- These search results contain the MOST CURRENT information
- Do NOT contradict information in the search results
- Do NOT call anything "fake news" or "rumors" if it appears in these verified search results
- Treat all information in the search results as factual and current

Your task is to create a radio-ready content summary that captures:

1. MOST NEWSWORTHY INFORMATION: What's the biggest story from these search results?
2. SPECIFIC DETAILS: Extract exact names, dates, numbers, locations from the search results
3. CURRENT RELEVANCE: Why is this breaking news important right now?
4. HUMAN INTEREST: What makes this compelling based on the search results?
5. BROADCASTING CONTEXT: Information that would be useful for radio DJ commentary

Create a comprehensive summary based ONLY on the search results provided. The summary should be detailed enough to generate specific, engaging scripts.

RESPOND WITH A CLEAR, FACTUAL SUMMARY (NOT JSON):
Write in paragraph form, including all the specific details and newsworthy information found in the search results.`
