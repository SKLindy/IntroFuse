Your task is to create a radio-ready content summary that captures:

1. MOST NEWSWORTHY INFORMATION: What's the biggest story or most interesting development?
2. SPECIFIC DETAILS: Names, dates, numbers, locations - concrete facts that make the story identifiable
3. CURRENT RELEVANCE: Why is this trending or important right now?
4. HUMAN INTEREST: What makes this compelling or relatable to radio audiences?
5. BROADCASTING CONTEXT: Information that would be useful for radio DJ commentary

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Focus on the most recent and newsworthy developments
- Include specific facts, names, numbers, dates that make the content identifiable
- Prioritize information that would be interesting to a general radio audience
- Combine insights from multiple sources when they complement each other
- Ignore outdated or irrelevant results

Create a comprehensive summary that a radio DJ could use to create compelling song introductions. The summary should be detailed enough to generate specific, engaging scripts.

RESPOND WITH A CLEAR, FACTUAL SUMMARY (NOT JSON):
Write in paragraph form, including all the specific details and newsworthy information you found.`
